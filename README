CEO Behavior and Firm Performance - Replication Study
------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains a replication study and extension of "CEO Behavior and Firm Performance" by Bandiera et al. (2020). The original paper analyzes how CEO behavior patterns correlate with firm performance using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
-----------------
Our replication focuses on:
- Translating the original Python code to R for broader accessibility
- Replicating key analyses including PCA and K-means clustering
- Conducting robustness experiments
- Extending the original analysis with additional behavioral dimensions


Data Files

Original Data
---------------
1. survey_response_data.csv: Raw CEO time-use survey data from the original study
2. accounts_matched_collapsed.dta: Collapsed dataset containing firm performance metrics
3. correlation_data: Dataset used to construct correlation matrices in the original paper

Extended Data
--------------
1. Accounts_matched_collapsed_with_extensions.dta: Enhanced version of the collapsed dataset including new behavioral variables:
  - Market relations
  - Non-market relations
  - Fixer variables
2. extension_indeces.csv: Mapping file connecting the new behavioral variables to CEO IDs


Code Structure

Replication Code
----------------
1. PCA_kmeans_replication.R: R translation of the original Python code for PCA and K-means clustering analysis
2. tables_recreated.R: R code to reproduce the original paper's tables

Experimental Analysis
---------------------
1. kmeans_seed.R: First robustness experiment examining sensitivity to random seed selection
2. EFA_6vars.R: Second experiment part 1 - Exploratory Factor Analysis using original 6 variables
3. EFA.R: Second experiment part 2 - Expanded Exploratory Factor Analysis using all variables

Extension Analysis
------------------
1. extension.R: Implementation of new behavioral dimensions analysis, including table generation


------
Usage
------
We recommend running the PCA_kmeans_replication.R file first as this will create the necessary variables and data frames to run the other files.
