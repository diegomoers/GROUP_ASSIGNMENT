DATA:
1. survey_response_data.csv is the raw data file, provided by the original authors.
2. accounts_matched_collapsed.dta is the collapsed dataset, also provided by the original authors.
3. Accounts_matched_collapsed_with_extensions.dta is the collapsed dataset, edited to included the market_relations, non_market_relations, and fixer variables. This was the dataset used to run the extension.
4. correlation_data was provided by the original authors, and used to construct the correlation matrix.
5. extension_indeces.csv has the market_relations, non_market_relations, and fixer variables matched to ID. Used to create Accounts_matched_collapsed_with_extenstions.dta.


CODE:
1. PCA_kmeans_replication.R is the R-translated code to the PCA and K-means clustering.
2. tables_recreated.R is the R-translated code to replicate the original tables only.
3. kmeans_seed.R is the code for the first experiment related to changing the seed.
4. EFA_6vars.R runs part of the code for the second experiment, for the same 6 variables originally used by the authors.
5. EFA.R is the other part of the code for the second experiment, runs the EFa for all variables.
5. extension.R is the code for the extension part of the paper, including the corresponding table.
